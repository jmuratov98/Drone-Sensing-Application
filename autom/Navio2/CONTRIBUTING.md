## Commit messages

We use the following format for our commit messages:

**C++: Examples: Barometer: add Navio 2 support**

- Prepend the message with subsystem, separated by a colon. Subsystem can be a source file, like stream.c or a part of the repository, like docs. Big projects might require several subsystems
- Write present-tense, imperative-style commit messages
- First line of the commit message is called a summary. Summary is 80 characters max, no dot at the end
- If an issue is not trivial, a detailed explanation text is required after the summary. In some cases, it is fine to use a dot list(use symbol '-')
- Optionally, you can reference the corresponding Github issue inside your commit message

## Pull requests

A pull request should always have a nice title that describes what it is about. It shouldn't be autogenerated from the last commit message. The PR's body should have:

- a comprehensive list of changes
- motivation
- be nice and polite
- check spelling and grammar
- sometimes it makes sense to add a log file, a screenshot, a logic analyzer data. In other words, some proof
